# High-level cross contract calls

<!-- MAGIC COMMENT: DO NOT DELETE! Everything above this line is hidden on NEAR Examples page -->

Example of using cross-contract functions, like promises, or money transfers.

**Note**: many other examples use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) to spin up an environment where smart contracts and their frontend can be quickly accessed. This example is best run locally with `nearcore`, as the instructions will explain.

# Instructions

We will use three tabs (or separate windows) in Terminal for this example:

1. **example tab** - this example project (likely `…/rust-high-level-cross-contract`)
2. **nearcore tab** - nearcore running an instance
3. **app tab** - small JavaScript app generated with `create-near-app`

Let's start the NEAR localnet so we can run a smart contract on it.

-   Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
-   Clone the [nearprotocol/nearcore](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore) repository

To start your local node, go to the **nearcore tab** and run the following commands:

    rm -rf ~/.near
    ./scripts/start_localnet.py

This will pull the docker image and start a single local node. When prompted, enter the account name `test_near` to be associated with that account. Just to be clear, this account does not live on testnet but on the localnet. It is not possible to, for example, log into this account with the NEAR Wallet after this example. Then execute the following to follow the block production logs:

    docker logs --follow nearcore

In a new tab, create a project:

    npx create-near-app --vanilla myproject
    cd myproject
    yarn

This tab is the **app tab**. In `src/config.json` change the `CONTRACT_NAME` to be `test_near`:

Replace:

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'near-blank-project';

with:

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'test_near';

In the same file, modify `nodeUrl` to point to your local node:

    case 'development':
        return {
            networkId: 'default',
            nodeUrl: 'http://localhost:3030', // ⟵ change this line
            contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
            walletUrl: 'https://wallet.nearprotocol.com',
        };

Then copy the key that the node generated upon starting in your local project to use for transaction signing. (The `~/.near` folder was populated when we started the localnet in the **nearcore tab**)

    mkdir ./neardev/default
    cp ~/.near/validator_key.json ./neardev/default/test_near.json

Create the `cross_contract` account from `test_near` with an initial balance:

    near create_account cross_contract --masterAccount test_near  --initialBalance 10000000

## Deploying the `cross_contract` contract

You'll want to run the following `near deploy` command from the same **app tab** that you've been in, but you'll need to know the full path to the location of this repository (the **example tab**) on your machine.

If you're not sure about that path, or just want to copy and paste it, switch to your **example tab** and run:

    pwd

Then, back in your **app tab**, run:

    near deploy --accountId cross_contract --wasmFile YOUR_PATH_HERE/res/cross_contract_high_level.wasm

## Deploying another contract

Let's deploy another contract using the `cross_contract` that we just deployed, factory-style:

    near call cross_contract deploy_status_message '{"account_id": "status_message", "amount":1000000000000000}' --accountId test_near

## Trying money transfer

While still in the **app tab**, first check the balance on both `status_message` and `cross_contract` accounts:

    near state cross_contract
    near state status_message

See that `cross_contract` has just shy of `10,000,000` and `status_message` has `0.000000001` tokens.

Then call a function on `cross_contract` that transfers money to `status_message`:

    near call cross_contract transfer_money '{"account_id": "status_message", "amount":1000000000000000}' --accountId test_near

Then check the balances again:

    near state cross_contract
    near state status_message

Observe that `status_message` has `0.000000002` tokens, even though `test_near` signed the transaction and paid for all the gas that was used.

## Trying simple cross contract call

Call `simple_call` function on `cross_contract` account:

    near call cross_contract simple_call '{"account_id": "status_message", "message":"bonjour"}' --accountId test_near --gas 10000000000000000000

Verify that this actually resulted in correct state change in `status_message` contract:

    near call status_message get_status '{"account_id":"test_near"}' --accountId test_near --gas 10000000000000000000

Observe:

    'bonjour'

## Trying complex cross contract call

Call `complex_call` function on `cross_contract` account:

    near call cross_contract complex_call '{"account_id": "status_message", "message":"halo"}' --accountId test_near --gas 10000000000000000000

Observe:

    'halo'

What just happened?

1. `test_near` account signed a transaction that called a `complex_call` method on `cross_contract` smart contract.
2. `cross_contract` executed `complex_call` with `account_id: "status_message", message: "halo"` arguments;
    1. During the execution the promise #0 was created to call `set_status` method on `status_message` with arguments `"message": "halo"`;
    2. Then another promise #1 was scheduled to be executed right after promise #0. Promise #1 was to call `get_status` on `status_message` with arguments: `"message": "test_near""`;
    3. Then the return value of `get_status` is programmed to be the return value of `complex_call`;
3. `status_message` executed `set_status`, then `status_message` executed `get_status` and got the `"halo"` return value which is then passed as the return value of `complex_call`.

## Trying callback with return values

Call `merge_sort` function on `cross_contract` account:

    near call cross_contract merge_sort '{"arr": [2, 1, 0, 3]}' --accountId test_near --gas 10000000000000000000

Observe the logs:

    [cross_contract]: Received [2] and [1]
    [cross_contract]: Merged [1, 2]
    [cross_contract]: Received [0] and [3]
    [cross_contract]: Merged [0, 3]
    [cross_contract]: Received [1, 2] and [0, 3]
    [cross_contract]: Merged [0, 1, 2, 3]

And the output:

    '\u0004\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0002\u0003'

The reason why output is a binary is because we used [Borsh](http://borsh.io) binary serialization format to communicate between the contracts instead of JSON. Borsh is faster and costs less gas. In this simple example you can even read the format, here `\u0004\u0000\u0000\u0000` stands for `4u32` encoded using little-endian encoding which corresponds to the length of the array, `\u0000\u0001\u0002\u0003` are the elements of the array. Since the array has type `Vec<u8>` each element is exactly one byte.

If you don't want to use it you can remove `#[serializer(borsh)]` annotation everywhere from the code and the contract will fall back to JSON.

Finally, you may stop the running docker container(s) by running this command in the **nearcore tab**:

    ./scripts/stop.py

# Playing with the code

After you make changes in `src/lib.rs`, recompile the contract with:

    yarn build

Then redeploy the contract, following the "deploying the `cross_contract` contract" instructions above.
